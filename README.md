======================

Rules
-----

You work in pairs, 45 min. for each iteration.


Iteration 1
-----------

Just write the Game of Life!

Iteration 2
-----------

* Use TDD
* Only one assertion in tests
* For each test:
    * First, it's 'failed'
    * It's as simple as possible
    * It's as simply fixed as possible
* You and your teammate exchange seats every 5 minutes

Iteration 3
-----------
* Methods are less than 3 lines
* Infinite game field (we're failed actually, we made it cyclic)
* Don't use mouse :)
* You and your teammate exchange seats every 5 minutes

Iteration 4
-----------
* Choose one (or more) option(s):
    1. Don't use mouse
    2. Three min. blocks: plan then do
* Choose one (or more) option(s):
    1. No loops (for, while, foreach, whatelse)
    2. No if and switch
    3. No variables (only immutable names, Haskell-style)
* You and your teammate exchange seats every 5 minutes


Iteration 5 (homework)
-----------
* No loops
* No variables
* No more than 2 statements per method
* No more than 5 methods per class
